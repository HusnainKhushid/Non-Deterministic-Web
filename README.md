# Non-Deterministic Web

A visually stunning, AI-powered Flask app that generates modern, minimalist HTML pages on-the-fly using Google Gemini. Every route produces a unique, self-contained web experienceâ€”no two visits are ever the same!

## Features
- **Non-deterministic design:** Each page is generated fresh, with random layouts, color schemes, and content.
- **Gemini-powered creativity:** Uses Google Gemini to create elegant, accessible HTML5 pages.
- **Fast & secure:** No external assets, only inline CSS/JS and SVGs.
- **Explore deeply:** Every page includes smart navigation links to deeper routes, making the site endlessly explorable.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
3. Run locally:
